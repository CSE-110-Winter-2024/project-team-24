# Team 24 - Successorator 

---

## Milestone 1 Velocity Calculations

### Iteration 1

 - **Initial velocity estimation: 0.5**

### Iteration 2

 - Factors taken into consideration:
   - All group members with major time conflicts preventing many in person meetings
   - Heavy coursework loads
   - Midterm fiasco siphoning time to work on Successorator
   - Relative lightening of work and exams of all group members in iteration 2
 - Conclusions:
   - Majority of work for iteration 1 must be pushed to iteration 2
   - Increase work days from 5 to 7 days a week
   - **Decrease velocity to 0.4**
 - Iteration 2 work hours: 6*7*4 = 168 potential work hours -> 0.4*168 = **67.2 total work hours**

## Milestone 2 Velocity Calculations

### Iteration 1

 - Factors taken into consideration:
   - Availibility of all group members for iteration 1
   - Performance of team during iteration 2 of Milestone 1
   - Difficulty of the tasks for iteration 1
 - Conclusions:
   - **Maintain velocity of 0.4**, carried over from iteration 2 of MS1
 - Iteration 1 work hours: 6*5*4 = 120 potential work hours -> 0.4*120 = **48 total work hours**

### Iteration 2
 - Factors taken into consideration:
   - All group members with major time conflicts preventing many in person meetings
   - Heavy coursework loads
   - Amount of work left in entire project
   - Certain tasks led to many unexpected problems, leading the task to take much longer than the initial estimation
 - Conclusions:
   - Roll over any tasks that were unfinished in iteration 1 to iteration 2
   - Maintain the 7 days per week of work, as most member had time during the weekends
   - Increase hours per day from 4 to 5 hours
   - **Decrease velocity to 0.3**
 - Iteration 2 work hours: 6*7*5 = 210 potential work hours -> 210*0.3 = **63 total work hours**
