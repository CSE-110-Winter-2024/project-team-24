# Team 24 - Successorator 

---

This is the mostly empty template for the Successorator project.

## Getting Started

 - [ ] Look around the project.
   - The `docs/` directory may be helpful, as Slack/Discord messages are easy to lose.
     - This is a good place to put finalized user stories, standards, guidelines, meeting notes, etc
       that you want to stick with the repository in perpetuity (e.g. after the semester ends) e.g.
       for portfolio purposes.
     - Google Docs is easier for collaboration, but eventually you might want to put the
       finalized versions here for reference. (This way you can also reference them in PRs!)
 - [ ] Modify the `.github/pull_request_template.md` to suit your needs.
   - You **do not** need to use the exact same template, but justify your changes when you 
     PR the updated template.
 - [ ] Replace this README with something appropriate.
   - **When you do, replace the title to replace X with your team number.**

## Milestone 2 Velocity Calculations

### Iteration 1

 - Factors taken into consideration:
   - Availibility of all group members for iteration 1
   - Performance of team during iteration 2 of Milestone 1
   - Difficulty of the tasks for iteration 1
 - Conclusion: A velocity of 0.4 will be used, carried over from iteration 2 of MS1.

### Iteration 2
 - Factors taken into consideration:
   - All group members with major time conflicts preventing many in person meetings
   - Heavy coursework loads
   - Amount of work left in entire project
   - Certain tasks led to many unexpected problems, leading the task to take much longer than the initial estimation
 - Conclusions:
   - Roll over any tasks that were unfinished in iteration 1 to iteration 2
   - Maintain the 7 days per week of work, as most member had time during the weekends
   - 4*6*7 = 168 potential work hours -> 168*0.35 = **58.8 hours**
